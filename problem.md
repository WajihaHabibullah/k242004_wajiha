Task 01: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.

Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Input dividend (N).
Step 3: Input divisor (n).
Step 4: Set a as integer.
Step 5: If N / n = a,  then go to step 7  else go to step 6.
Step 6: Print “it is not divisible.” then go to step 8.
Step 7: If a % 2 = 0 then print “Even” else print “Odd”.
Step 8: Stop.
